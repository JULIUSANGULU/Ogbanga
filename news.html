        <h2>Muslim clerics demand legislation against preaching with megaphones</h2>
        <p>
            They said that Nigeria is a multi-religious society and that using a megaphone to preach would amount to insensitivity to others when one faith forces its preachings on others unsolicited.

They said that people should be educated on societal undoing that could cause religious disorder through the use of loud megaphones from worship centres and street preachings.

The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the use of loud megaphones for religious preachings is common in most Nigerian cities with its attendant inter-faith frictions.
